   - Responsive: xs={12} sm={6} md={4} lg={3}

ISSUES FOUND AND FIXED
======================

ISSUE #1: PAGINATION BUTTONS - CRITICAL (FIXED)
Component: AgentsPage.jsx

Problem: HTML buttons with inline styles, no theme integration
- Used HTML <button> with hardcoded colors (#333, #FF8C42)
- No Material-UI theming support
- No smooth transitions or hover states
- Accessibility issues with disabled states

Solution Applied:
- Added Button import from Material-UI
- Replaced both buttons with Material-UI Button component
- Applied proper hover colors (#CC6600 for dark Meow Orange)
- Used theme colors for disabled state (#6B7A90)
- Added smooth transitions (150ms ease-in-out)
- Enhanced mobile responsiveness with flexWrap

ISSUE #2: TOGGLE BUTTON HOVER STATE - MEDIUM (FIXED)
Component: AgentFilters.jsx

Problem: Arbitrary hover color (#E67E3A) didn't match theme
- Missing transition animations
- No secondary hover state for unselected buttons

Solution Applied:
- Changed hover color to #CC6600 (proper Meow Orange dark)
- Added 150ms ease-in-out transition
- Added hover state for unselected buttons
- Improved visual feedback hierarchy

ISSUE #3: STATS WIDGET STYLING - MINOR (FIXED)
Component: AgentStatsWidget.jsx

Problem: Gradient opacity and transitions could be more consistent
- Gradient opacity 0.1 slightly too strong
- Transition timing 0.3s slower than system standard
- Missing border-radius specification
- Conservative hover effects

Solution Applied:
- Reduced gradient opacity to 0.08 (subtler effect)
- Standardized transition to 250ms (matches system)
- Added borderRadius: 2 for consistency
- Enhanced hover transform from -4px to -6px
- Increased hover shadow from 4 to 6
