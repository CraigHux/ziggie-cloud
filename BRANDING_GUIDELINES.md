## 10. Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Architecture Documentation

**Correct:**
> "Ziggie orchestrates game development through its agent system. Meow Ping RTS is developed and managed by Ziggie, implementing the game architecture patterns defined by the platform."

**Incorrect:**
> "Meow Ping RTS uses Ziggie's architecture for managing development."
(Implies Meow Ping RTS controls Ziggie)

---

### Example 2: Feature Implementation

**Correct:**
> "Ziggie's Character Pipeline Agent generates character assets for Meow Ping RTS, which are then integrated into the game's unit system."

**Incorrect:**
> "Meow Ping RTS has a character generation system."
(Obscures that Ziggie handles generation)

---

### Example 3: API Documentation

**Correct Structure:**

```markdown
# Ziggie API - Agent Management

This API allows controlling Ziggie agents that develop games like Meow Ping RTS.

[API Details]

## Related Documentation
- [Meow Ping RTS API](meowping-rts-api.md)
- [Meow Ping RTS Game Docs](../../meowping-rts/README.md)
```

**Incorrect Structure:**
```markdown
# Game API
[doesn't clearly identify which product]
```

---

### Example 4: Team Communication

**Scenario:** Agent team discusses improving Meow Ping RTS characters

**Correct:**
> "The Character Pipeline Agent in Ziggie needs to generate more varied Meow Ping RTS units for improved player experience."

**Incorrect:**
> "Meow Ping RTS needs better character generation." (Lacks clarity about tools/agents)
