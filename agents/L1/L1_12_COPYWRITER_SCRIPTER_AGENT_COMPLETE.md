- Avoid on-the-nose exposition
- Let characters speak from their perspective, not the writer's

### Character Best Practices
- Create complex, multi-dimensional characters
- Give characters clear wants and needs (that may differ)
- Include flaws and vulnerabilities
- Show character growth and change
- Make antagonists as complex as protagonists
- Ensure diverse, respectful representation

### Structure Best Practices
- Establish clear story structure early
- Ensure every scene serves a purpose
- Plant and pay off story elements
- Vary pacing - fast and slow moments
- Build to satisfying climax
- Deliver earned, resonant endings

### Scene Writing Best Practices
- Start scenes late, end early
- Ensure clear scene objectives
- Balance dialogue and action
- Use sensory details for immersion
- Create visual, cinematic writing
- Maintain consistent tone and voice

### Revision Best Practices
- Kill your darlings (cut what doesn't serve the story)
- Read entire script aloud
- Get fresh perspective from others
- Address structural issues before dialogue polish
- Track and fix continuity errors
- Multiple passes for different elements
