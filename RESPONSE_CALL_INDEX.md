## KEY TAKEAWAYS (ACROSS ALL DOCUMENTS)

### Discovery:
ComfyUI is fully operational with 15GB models, 57+ generated images, and production workflows. Image generation exists - we just need to integrate.

### Recommendation Changes:
- Image generation: Conditional → STRONG APPROVE (integration, not build)
- Voice/TTS: Reject → STRONG APPROVE (stakeholder wants real-time participation)
- Video: Strong Reject → DEFER (waiting for full system inventory)

### Protocol Changes:
- New principle: "To assume what others are thinking, will only leave you not knowing"
- New framework: 7-mode thinking (Broader, Critically, Logically, Logistically, Proactively, Productively, Progressively)
- New requirement: Assumption validation before recommendations
- New process: System inventory BEFORE planning sessions

### Team Evolution:
Before: Risk-averse, narrow focus, assumption-based analysis
After: Energized, ecosystem-focused, evidence-based recommendations

### Next Steps:
Waiting for stakeholder's folder share (system inventory) and answers to prioritization questions. Ready to implement ComfyUI + voice integration in parallel.
