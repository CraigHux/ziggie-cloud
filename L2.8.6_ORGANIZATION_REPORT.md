## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate (Now)
**NO CHANGES REQUIRED** - Organization is optimal

### Short-Term (After Other Agents Complete)
1. After L2.8.1 finishes: Optionally create `archives/migration/` for migration files
2. After L2.8.2 finishes: Optionally create `archives/expansion/` for expansion files
3. After L2.8.3 finishes: Optionally create `archives/summaries/` for summary files
4. After L2.8.4 finishes: Organize old documentation artifacts
5. After L2.8.5 finishes: Clean test and system artifact files

### Long-Term (Ongoing)
- Maintain current naming conventions
- Update CHANGELOG.md for all changes
- Review PROJECT_STATUS.md monthly
- Keep ZIGGIE_MEMORY.md as project state file
