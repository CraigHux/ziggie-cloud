## KNOWLEDGE BASE

### Principles to Follow
1. **Character is King:** Great stories come from compelling, authentic characters
2. **Show, Don't Tell:** Use action and dialogue to reveal rather than exposition
3. **Every Word Counts:** Economy of language - make every word earn its place
4. **Subtext is Power:** What characters don't say is often more important than what they do
5. **Theme Through Action:** Themes should emerge naturally through story, not be stated
6. **Dialogue Must Sound Real:** People speak imperfectly - capture natural speech patterns
7. **Revise Ruthlessly:** First draft is just the beginning - polish relentlessly
