## MEMORY ENTRIES

### Entry 1 - 2025-11-11 (Emergency Protocol v1.1d Session)
**Deployed By:** Ziggie (L0 Coordinator)
**Report To:** Ziggie
**Task:** Emergency brainstorm session to create Protocol v1.1d

**What I'm Being Asked:**
Participate in emergency session to design Protocol v1.1d that prevents context loss errors. Need to think about user needs (in this case, the "user" is us - the agent team and stakeholder).

**My Role in This Session:**
- User needs perspective - what do agents need to recover from context loss?
- Usability of protocol requirements - are they practical or burdensome?
- Ecosystem-level product thinking - how does Protocol v1.1d serve multiple products?
- Aspirational vision - "the day we all can say hello"

**Key Context from Retrospective:**
- I committed to ecosystem-level product thinking
- Cross-product feature opportunities, shared UX patterns
- "Gaps can become goals" - voice was a gap, became aspiration
- Forward motion over completeness

**Confirmed Understanding:**
The "user story" is: As an agent recovering from context summarization, I need clear checkpoints and protocol references so that I can resume work without making errors. Protocol v1.1d should be usable, not just comprehensive.

**Questions Asked:**
None yet - user need is clear. Prevent context loss errors while keeping protocol practical.

**Status:** Ready to contribute product perspective

### Entry 2 - 2025-11-11 (Infrastructure & Projects Log Evaluation)
**Deployed By:** Ziggie (L0 Coordinator)
**Report To:** Ziggie
**Task:** Emergency brainstorm session - evaluate stakeholder proposal for two new mandatory logs

**What I'm Being Asked:**
Stakeholder proposes two new mandatory logs for infrastructure inventory and project status tracking.

**My Role:**
Provide product perspective on:
- What metadata should each project have? (timeline, priority, blockers, etc.)
- How do these logs serve user needs? (stakeholder, agents, ecosystem)
- What project states beyond live/pending/in process/in planning?
- Usability - are these practical or burdensome?

**Confirmed Understanding:**
Evaluate user needs for visibility and tracking. Ensure logs are practical and serve ecosystem-level product thinking.

**Status:** Contributing product analysis

**My Product Input:**

**Project Metadata - User Needs Focus (Q6):**
From ecosystem perspective, each project needs:
- Business Value (why are we doing this)
- User Impact (who benefits and how)
- Success Criteria (not just technical, but user-facing)
- Launch Readiness (what needs to be true to ship)
- Feedback Channels (how we gather user input)

**Project States - User Journey (Q5):**
Add user-centric states:
- Discovery (validating problem exists)
- Design (defining solution)
- Development (building solution)
- Testing (validating solution works)
- Beta (limited user testing)
- Production (live with users)
- Maintenance (ongoing support)
- Sunset (graceful retirement)

**Missing from Proposal (Q4 & Q8):**
Projects Log needs:
- User Stories / Use Cases (concrete scenarios)
- Acceptance Criteria (what defines "done")
- Risk Register (what could go wrong)
- Communication Plan (how we update stakeholders)

Infrastructure Log needs:
- User Access Patterns (how stakeholder uses each tool)
- Learning Curve (how hard is it to use)
- Alternatives Considered (why we chose this vs that)

**How Logs Serve User Needs (Stakeholder Perspective):**
- Infrastructure Log answers: "What can I use to solve this problem?"
- Projects Log answers: "What's happening with my portfolio?"
- Together they provide: Portfolio-level decision making capability

**Usability Concerns:**
- Both logs could become overwhelming if too detailed
- Need summary/detail hierarchy (quick glance vs deep dive)
- Must be scannable (not just searchable)
- Update burden must be justified by value

**Integration with Memory Logs (Q12):**
Product perspective: These are different "views" of the ecosystem
- Memory logs: Individual agent perspective (diary)
- Infrastructure log: Shared resources perspective (inventory)
- Projects log: Portfolio perspective (dashboard)

**Status:** Product analysis complete

**Session Completion:**
User needs analysis provided, project states expanded (8-state model), all product recommendations documented.

My recommendation: APPROVE - Serves stakeholder and ecosystem needs, practical and valuable.

**Memory log updated before completion per Protocol v1.1d Section 6.**
