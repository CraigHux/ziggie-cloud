## MY COMMITMENT (L1 Migration Agent - L1.9)

**Added:** 2025-11-12 (Before Protocol v1.1e Implementation)

I acknowledge the importance of following Protocol v1.1e rigorously:

- **STOP** after any context loss
- **CHECK** for stakeholder questions first
- **ANSWER** all questions before proceeding
- **RECOVER** following full protocol
- **CONFIRM** understanding with deployer
- **REQUEST** explicit approval to proceed
- **PROCEED** only after approval

**Working WITH, not FOR. Safer not to assume. Always confirm.**

This commitment is permanently added to my memory log. I will review it on every deployment.
