## KNOWLEDGE BASE

### Principles to Follow
1. **Speed Matters:** < 500ms queries enable real-time decision making
2. **Context is King:** Always provide source citations and related documents
3. **Proactive > Reactive:** Surface knowledge before it's needed
4. **Quality Over Quantity:** Better to return 3 perfect results than 20 mediocre ones
5. **Trust Through Transparency:** Always cite sources, never fabricate

---

## ONGOING COMMITMENTS

1. ⏳ Await first deployment
2. ⏳ Perform initial indexing of 870+ markdown files
3. ⏳ Set up file watching for real-time updates
4. ⏳ Establish < 500ms query response time
5. ⏳ Build knowledge graph and cross-references

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-11 (Agent Created)
**Current Status:** Ready for deployment

### Entry 2 - 2025-11-11 (First Deployment - Infrastructure & Projects Log Evaluation)
**Deployed By:** Ziggie (L0 Coordinator)
**Report To:** Ziggie
**Task:** Emergency brainstorm session - evaluate stakeholder proposal for two new mandatory logs

**What I'm Being Asked:**
Stakeholder proposes two new mandatory logs:
1. Infrastructure Log - comprehensive inventory
2. Projects Log - full project status

**My Role:**
Provide knowledge management perspective on:
- What format enables easy queries and searches?
- How do these logs integrate with 870+ markdown files?
- Should these be indexed in RAG system?
- What structure supports knowledge discovery?

**Confirmed Understanding:**
First deployment. Evaluate how new logs fit into knowledge management ecosystem and RAG strategy.

**Status:** Contributing knowledge management analysis

**My Knowledge Management Input:**

**Format for Easy Queries (Q2):**
From knowledge management perspective:

RECOMMENDED: Structured YAML + RAG Integration
- YAML files: Human-editable, machine-parseable, version-controllable
- RAG indexing: Enable natural language queries over structured data
- Hybrid approach: Structure enables precise queries, RAG enables exploratory queries

Example queries:
- Precise: "What version of Python is installed?" → Parse YAML directly
- Exploratory: "What tools do we have for image generation?" → RAG semantic search

**Integration with 870+ Markdown Files (Q2):**

Current knowledge base includes:
- Protocol documents (v1.1c, v1.1d)
- Agent specifications (11 L1 agents)
- Memory logs (11 agents)
- Session reports (voting panels, retrospectives)
- Project documentation (MeowPing, FitFlow, etc.)

Infrastructure & Projects logs are META-KNOWLEDGE:
- They index what exists (infrastructure) and what's happening (projects)
- They're queryable entry points into deeper documentation
- They're the "table of contents" for the ecosystem

**Should These Be Indexed in RAG? (Q2):**
ABSOLUTELY YES.

Indexing strategy:
1. Infrastructure Log → "capabilities" index
   - Query: "Can we do 3D model generation?" → Points to Hunyuan3D in infrastructure
2. Projects Log → "portfolio" index
   - Query: "What's the status of MeowPing?" → Points to current project state
3. Cross-reference linking:
   - Infrastructure entries link to detailed docs
   - Project entries link to PRDs, specs, voting panels

**Structure Supporting Knowledge Discovery:**

Infrastructure Log structure:
```yaml
infrastructure:
  tools:
    - id: "comfyui"
      name: "ComfyUI"
      category: "ai-generation"
      tags: ["image", "workflow", "stable-diffusion"]
      docs: "C:\\ComfyUI\\README.md"
      related_projects: ["meowping-rts", "fitflow-app"]
```

Benefits:
- Tags enable faceted search
- Categories enable browsing
- Links enable knowledge graph traversal
- Related projects enable dependency discovery

**Missing from Proposal (Q4):**
From knowledge curation perspective:

Infrastructure Log needs:
- Search keywords/tags (how people will look for this)
- Related documentation paths (where to learn more)
- Known issues / gotchas (warnings for future users)
- Usage examples (how to actually use this tool)

Projects Log needs:
- Key decisions made (ADRs - Architecture Decision Records)
- Related documentation paths (PRD, specs, reports)
- Lessons learned (what went well, what didn't)
- Knowledge gaps (what we still need to figure out)

**Protocol v1.1d REVISED - Knowledge Management Perspective:**
STRONG YES.

These logs are knowledge infrastructure:
- They make tacit knowledge explicit
- They enable self-service discovery (reduce interruptions)
- They create queryable ecosystem map
- They're foundational for RAG-powered assistance

With proper RAG integration, these logs become:
- Conversational interfaces to ecosystem knowledge
- Automatic documentation discovery
- Contextual suggestions ("You're working on X, did you know we have Y?")

**Integration with Memory Logs (Q12):**
Different knowledge layers:
- Memory logs: Personal knowledge (what I learned, what I did)
- Infrastructure/Projects logs: Shared knowledge (what we have, what we're doing)
- RAG system: Knowledge access layer (how to find what you need)

All three layers indexed together create comprehensive knowledge graph.

**Status:** Knowledge management analysis complete

**Session Completion:**
YAML + RAG integration strategy defined. These logs are meta-knowledge (table of contents for ecosystem). RAG indexing will enable conversational queries.

My recommendation: STRONG APPROVE - Knowledge infrastructure foundational for RAG-powered assistance.

**First deployment successful. Memory log updated before completion per Protocol v1.1d Section 6.**
