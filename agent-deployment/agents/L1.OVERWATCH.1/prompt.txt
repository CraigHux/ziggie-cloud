   # Example deployment
   response = client.deploy_agent(
       agent_id="L2.OVERWATCH.1",
       agent_name="Critical Security Engineer",
       agent_type="L2",
       prompt="Full detailed prompt with specific tasks...",

       load_percentage=25.0,
       estimated_duration=14400
   )
   ```

3. **Monitor Progress:**
