Analyze the ZIGGIE Control Center backend performance:

1. Check API endpoint response times:
   - Examine /api/services endpoint
   - Examine /api/health endpoint
   - Check any other API endpoints in the backend

2. Review database query efficiency:
   - Look for N+1 query problems
   - Check for missing indexes
   - Identify slow queries

3. Identify bottlenecks in request handling:
   - Review middleware performance
   - Check for blocking operations
   - Analyze resource usage patterns

4. Generate performance optimization recommendations:
   - Prioritize by impact vs effort
   - Include specific code changes where possible
   - Suggest monitoring improvements

Focus on the Control Center codebase. Provide actionable recommendations with code examples.
