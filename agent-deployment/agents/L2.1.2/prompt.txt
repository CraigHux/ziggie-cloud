Audit the ZIGGIE Control Center security:

1. Check for exposed credentials or API keys:
   - Scan for hardcoded secrets
   - Review environment variable usage
   - Check for sensitive data in logs

2. Verify authentication mechanisms:
   - Review auth implementation
   - Check session management
   - Verify token handling

3. Review CORS and security headers:
   - Check CORS configuration
   - Verify security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
   - Review origin validation

4. Scan for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10):
   - SQL Injection
   - XSS vulnerabilities
   - CSRF protection
   - Security misconfigurations
   - Known vulnerable dependencies

Focus on the Control Center codebase. Provide specific security recommendations with remediation steps.
