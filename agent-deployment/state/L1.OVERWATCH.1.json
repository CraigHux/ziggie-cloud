Deploy ALL 4 L2 agents immediately\n2. Ensure each agent has SPECIFIC, ACTIONABLE tasks\n3. Include FILE PATHS and CODE EXAMPLES in prompts\n4. Set realistic time estimates\n5. Use Haiku model for cost efficiency\n6. Create status report after deployment\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA:\n\u00e2\u0153\u2026 All 4 L2 agents deployed successfully\n\u00e2\u0153\u2026 Each agent has clear, specific tasking\n\u00e2\u0153\u2026 Deployment coordinator confirms all PIDs\n\u00e2\u0153\u2026 Status report created\n\u00e2\u0153\u2026 Progress monitoring in place\n\nExecute this mission NOW. Deploy all 4 L2 agents and report deployment status.\n",
