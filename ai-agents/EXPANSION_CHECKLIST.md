## RISK MITIGATION

### Identified Risks

**Risk 1: Naming Inconsistency**
- Impact: Makes organization confusing
- Mitigation: Use CONSISTENCY_GUIDE.md as single source of truth
- Validation: Run monthly compliance checks

**Risk 2: Scope Creep (Too Many Sub-Agents)**
- Impact: Too granular, difficult to manage
- Mitigation: Stick to 12×12×12 structure (not larger)
- Validation: Review each agent for specialization level

**Risk 3: Communication Pathway Gaps**
- Impact: Agents can't coordinate effectively
- Mitigation: Document all relationships in AGENT_HIERARCHY_DIAGRAM.md
- Validation: Test navigation and cross-references

**Risk 4: File Location Scattered**
- Impact: Hard to find and manage files
- Mitigation: Enforce C:\Ziggie\ai-agents\ as only location
- Validation: Periodic directory audits

**Risk 5: Documentation Quality Decline**
- Impact: New agents not professional quality
- Mitigation: Mandatory use of TEMPLATE_L1_AGENT.md
- Validation: Peer review before final approval
