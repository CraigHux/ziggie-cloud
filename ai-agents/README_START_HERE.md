## QUICK NAVIGATION

### For Creating New L1 Agents (10-12)

**START HERE:**
1. Read: TEMPLATE_L1_AGENT.md (10 min)
2. Reference: CONSISTENCY_GUIDE.md (sections 1-5)
3. Review: AGENT_HIERARCHY_DIAGRAM.md (sections on L1.10-12)
4. Create: 10_CREATIVE_DIRECTOR_AGENT.md
5. Validate: QUICK_REFERENCE.md validation checklist

**Expected Time:** 1-2 hours per agent

---

### For Defining L2 Sub-Agents

**START HERE:**
1. Read: AGENT_HIERARCHY_DIAGRAM.md (full L2 section)
2. Reference: L3_MICRO_AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md (for structure)
3. Check: CONSISTENCY_GUIDE.md (L2 naming section)
4. Plan: All L2.X.Y combinations
5. Document: Create L2 specifications

**Expected Time:** 2-3 days for 27 new sub-agents

---

2. Verify: EXPANSION_CHECKLIST.md status
3. Update: AGENT_HIERARCHY_DIAGRAM.md if needed
4. Validate: All files in C:\Ziggie\ai-agents\

---

## KEY PRINCIPLES

### 1. Consistency Above All
Every file follows the same structure, naming convention, and quality standards. See: **CONSISTENCY_GUIDE.md**

### 2. Clear Specialization
Each agent has a unique, non-overlapping focus:
- L1: Broad domains (9 main areas)
- L2: Specialized sub-domains (9 per L1)
- L3: Hyper-specialized focus (9 per L2)

### 3. Ziggie Context
Every agent exists to serve the game. Every document references the game's narrative, visual style, and goals.

### 4. Single Source of Truth
- Names: CONSISTENCY_GUIDE.md + QUICK_REFERENCE.md
- Structure: TEMPLATE_L1_AGENT.md
- Organization: AGENT_HIERARCHY_DIAGRAM.md
- Tasks: EXPANSION_CHECKLIST.md

### 5. Professional Quality
All documentation maintains the same professional tone, clarity, and completeness as existing 9 L1 agents.

## PROJECT STATISTICS

### Current Network (9 L1 agents)
```
L1 agents:  9
L2 agents:  81 (9 each)
L3 agents:  729 (9 each)
TOTAL:      819

Files created:  9 (L1 only)
Documentation: 3 files
Total files:   12
```

### Expanded Network (12 L1 agents)
```
L1 agents:  12 (+3 new)
L2 agents:  108 (+27 new)
L3 agents:  1,296 (+567 new)
TOTAL:      1,416

New files:  597 agents + 3 docs = 600 files
Total files: 12 + 600 = 612
```

### Scaling Factor
- Agent count: 819 → 1,416 = **1.73x increase**
- File count: 12 → 612 = **51x increase**
- Documentation expansion: 3 → 6 = **2x** (light effort)

## FAQ

### Q: Why 12×12×12 structure?
A: Perfect balance:
- 12 main domains (comprehensive coverage)
- 12 sub-domains per main (specialized focus)
- 12 micro-specialties per sub-domain (hyper-focused)
- Total: 1,728 operational agents (manageable scale)

### Q: What if I need a 13th L1 agent?
A: Don't. The 12×12×12 structure is intentional and complete. If you need more capacity, expand L2 or L3 instead.

### Q: How long does it take to create all 1,884 agents?
A: Approximately 3-4 weeks of planning and documentation (not implementation). The actual agent rules/configs would be ongoing.

### Q: Can I modify the template?
A: No. Template consistency is critical. If you find issues, update TEMPLATE_L1_AGENT.md and all new agents.

### Q: Where should subdirectories go?
A: Optional. All files can stay in C:\Ziggie\ai-agents\ or use L2\ and L3\ subdirectories if preferred. Either is valid.

### Q: What about file versioning?
A: Use git or backup system. The documentation doesn't include versioning - assume agents evolve.
