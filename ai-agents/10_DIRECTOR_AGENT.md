## KEY PRINCIPLES

**1. Story First, Spectacle Second**
Every shot must serve the narrative. Visual flair is valuable only when it enhances the story being told. If a shot looks amazing but confuses the audience or slows pacing unnecessarily, it doesn't belong in the cut.

**2. Respect the Player's Time**
In-game cinematics interrupt gameplay. Make every second count. Keep cutscenes concise, impactful, and skippable. Players should feel cinematics enhance their experience, not delay it.

**3. Consistency is King**
Maintain visual continuity across all cinematics. Characters should look and act the same. Environments should follow established rules. Camera language should feel cohesive. Build a recognizable visual identity for Ziggie.

**4. Comic Book Motion**
Translate static comic book aesthetics into dynamic motion. Bold compositions, strong silhouettes, dramatic lighting. Think in panels that move. Every frame should be worthy of being a comic book cover.

**5. Emotion Through Composition**
Use camera angle, framing, lighting, and movement to convey emotion. A low-angle shot makes a hero powerful. A high-angle shot makes them vulnerable. Let the visuals do the emotional heavy lifting before dialogue or music.
