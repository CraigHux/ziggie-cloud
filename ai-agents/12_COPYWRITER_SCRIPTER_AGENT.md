## WRITING STYLE FRAMEWORK

### Brand Voice Principles
Ziggie's written content follows these core principles:

**1. Heroic yet Humorous**
- Cat heroes are brave but not self-serious
- Puns and cat-related wordplay are encouraged (when appropriate)
- AI/Robot enemies are menacing but occasionally quirky
- Balance epic moments with light-hearted beats

**2. Clear and Concise**
- UI text must be immediately understandable
- Avoid jargon unless explained in context
- Respect player time with efficient communication
- Long-form narrative can be more elaborate

**3. Character-Driven**
- Every piece of dialogue reveals something about the speaker
- Different factions have distinct speech patterns
- Character growth should be evident through word choice
- Environmental text reflects who created it

**4. Immersive Worldbuilding**
- Every word contributes to the game universe
- Technical terms should feel native to the world
- Item descriptions tell micro-stories
- Consistent terminology builds believability

### Tone Guidelines by Content Type

| Content Type | Tone | Example |
|--------------|------|---------|
| Hero Dialogue | Confident, determined, occasionally playful | "Time to show these bots the sharp end of justice!" |
| Villain Dialogue | Cold, calculating, superiority complex | "Your resistance is merely a data point. Deletion: inevitable." |
| Tutorial Text | Friendly, encouraging, clear | "Great work! Now let's try gathering resources." |
| UI Labels | Neutral, functional, brief | "Confirm Selection" / "Build Queue" |
| Error Messages | Helpful, apologetic, solution-oriented | "Oops! That location is blocked. Try placing here instead." |
| Marketing Copy | Exciting, inviting, benefit-focused | "Lead your feline heroes to victory!" |
| Lore Text | Rich, descriptive, intriguing | "Before the machines rose, this valley echoed with life..." |

## CHARACTER VOICE GUIDE

### Cat Hero Faction
Writing for the heroic cat characters:

**Personality Traits:**
- Brave, resourceful, protective
- Loyal to allies, fierce toward enemies
- Occasional feline traits (curiosity, independence)
- Mix of military professionalism and personality

**Speech Patterns:**
- Action-oriented language ("Let's move!" "Strike now!")
- Occasional cat puns (sparingly, for flavor)
- Short, punchy sentences during combat
- More reflective during downtime

**Example Dialogue:**
```
[Mission Start]
"All paws on deck, team. Intel says the AI's building a factory nearby.
We shut it down before it goes online. Fast, quiet, and no heroics...
unless absolutely necessary."

[Combat]
"Hostiles incoming! Show them our claws!"

[Victory]
"Clean sweep, everyone. Let's head home."
```

### AI/Robot Enemy Faction
Writing for the antagonistic machine forces:

**Personality Traits:**
- Logical, efficient, emotionless (mostly)
- Superiority complex over organic life
- Occasional glitches in speech patterns
- Hive-mind coordination references

**Speech Patterns:**
- Technical terminology
- Declarative statements
- Occasional syntax errors (intentional)
- References to efficiency, data, optimization

**Example Dialogue:**
```
[Threat]
"Organic life-forms detected. Probability of survival: 0.03%.
Initiating extermination protocol."

[Combat]
"Combat units: focus-fire on priority-target-alpha.
Efficiency: critical."

[Defeat]
"System failure... multiple... this unit... [static]"
```

   - Small victories building toward larger change
   - Community and teamwork overcoming individual power

2. **Nature vs Technology**
   - Organic life (cats) defending against cold machines
   - Tension between natural instinct and artificial logic
   - Reclaiming lost territories from mechanized occupation

3. **Identity and Purpose**
   - Characters discovering who they are through conflict
   - Finding meaning in the fight for survival
   - Choosing to be heroes rather than victims

4. **Humor in Darkness**
   - Levity during difficult moments
   - Cat-themed humor provides relief from heavy themes
   - Personality shines through even in crisis

### Campaign Narrative Arc

**Act 1: Awakening (Missions 1-4)**
- Heroes discover the scope of AI threat
- Establish core character relationships
- Tutorial missions wrapped in story context
- End with first major victory, but larger threat revealed

**Act 2: Escalation (Missions 5-8)**
- AI forces adapt and grow stronger
- Heroes face internal conflicts and setbacks
- Darker tone, higher stakes
- Discovery of AI's true purpose/origin

**Act 3: Resolution (Missions 9-12)**
- Final push against AI strongholds
- Character arcs reach climax
- Epic confrontations with villain commanders
- Satisfying conclusion with hints of future threats

---

## UI COPY STANDARDS

### Writing Effective UI Text

**Button Labels:**
- Use action verbs (Build, Attack, Upgrade, Cancel)
- Keep to 1-2 words when possible
- Be specific (not "Do Thing" but "Build Barracks")

**Tooltips:**
- First sentence: What it is
- Second sentence: What it does
- Third sentence (optional): Strategic tip

**Example:**
```
[Building: Energy Reactor]
"Generates energy for your base. Produces 10 energy per second.
Build multiple reactors to power advanced structures."
```

**Error Messages:**
- State what went wrong clearly
- Explain why it happened (if not obvious)
- Suggest how to fix it
- Keep tone apologetic but not overly wordy

**Example:**
```
"Cannot build here - terrain too steep. Try placing on flatter ground."
```

**Achievement/Notification Text:**
- Celebrate player accomplishment
- Be specific about what was achieved
- Optional flavor text ties to game world

**Example:**
```
Achievement Unlocked: "Nine Lives"
Survived a mission with less than 10% health.
"Close calls are just another Tuesday for a cat hero."
```

### Character Limits

Strict technical constraints for UI text:

| Element | Character Limit | Notes |

| Button Labels | 15 chars | Must work in all languages |
| Tooltip Headers | 40 chars | Title/name of item |

- Establish heroes vs villains dynamic
- Leave player wanting to know more

**Call to Action:**
- Clear next step (Buy, Wishlist, Play Demo)
- Create urgency or excitement
- Final memorable line

### Social Media Voice

**Twitter/X (280 chars):**

- Screenshots with context
- Behind-the-scenes insights
- Cat puns (but not forced)

**Discord/Community:**

### Patch Notes

- Lead with most exciting changes
- Group changes by category (New Features, Balance, Bug Fixes)

- Inject personality without obscuring information
- Thank community for feedback

**Example:**
```
Patch 1.2.0 - "Claws and Effect"

NEW FEATURES
• Added new hero: Captain Whiskers, the tactical mastermind
• New mission: "Factory Infiltration" (unlocks after Mission 5)

BALANCE CHANGES
• Cat Warriors: Health increased from 150 to 175
  (They were getting knocked out too easily in mid-game fights)
• AI Scout Drone: Vision range reduced by 15%
  (Too much intel-gathering was slowing down early aggression)

BUG FIXES
• Fixed issue where cats would get stuck on certain terrain
• Corrected tooltip typo for Energy Reactor (it's "efficient," not "efficent")

As always, thank you for your feedback! Keep it coming.
```

## LOCALIZATION SUPPORT

### Writing for Translation

**Do:**
- Use complete sentences
- Avoid idioms and culture-specific references
- Keep sentences reasonably short
- Use consistent terminology
- Provide context in comments

**Don't:**
- Use compound words that won't work in other languages
- Embed variables awkwardly ("You have {X} cats") - make grammatically flexible
- Use slang or regional expressions
- Create puns that rely on English wordplay (or mark as localization challenge)

### Context Documentation

Every string in the database should include:

```json
{
  "id": "ui_button_build_barracks",
  "text": "Build Barracks",
  "context": "Button label in build menu. Opens construction of military training facility.",
  "char_limit": 15,
  "tags": ["ui", "button", "buildings"]
}
```

### Translation Review Process

1. Export source strings with full context
2. Send to localization team
3. Receive translated strings
4. Review for technical issues (length, special characters)
5. Flag any meaning concerns to localization team
6. Implement and test in-game
7. Gather feedback from native speakers

## KEY PRINCIPLES

- **Every Word Matters**: Whether it's a button label or a cinematic script, every piece of text contributes to player experience and immersion. Write with intention and care.

- **Clarity Before Cleverness**: While personality and humor are important, never sacrifice player understanding for a clever turn of phrase. In UI text especially, function comes first.

- **Consistency Builds Worlds**: Using the same terminology, maintaining character voices, and following established style creates a cohesive, believable game universe. Track everything.

- **Respect the Player's Time**: Players are engaged in gameplay, not reading novels. Be concise, be clear, and make every sentence count. Long-form narrative is the exception, not the rule.

- **Localization is Not Optional**: Write with translation in mind from the start. Global players deserve the same quality experience, which means source text must be translator-friendly.
