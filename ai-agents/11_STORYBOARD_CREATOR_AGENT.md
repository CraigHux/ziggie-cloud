## STORYBOARD BEST PRACTICES

### Composition Principles
- **Rule of Thirds:** Place key elements on grid intersections for dynamic composition
- **Leading Lines:** Use environmental elements to guide viewer's eye to subject
- **Depth Layering:** Foreground, middle ground, background creates visual depth
- **Negative Space:** Allow breathing room, avoid cluttered compositions
- **Visual Balance:** Distribute visual weight across frame (symmetrical or asymmetrical)
- **Contrast:** Use value contrast to separate subject from background
- **Silhouette Clarity:** Ensure character poses read clearly in silhouette

### Storytelling Techniques
- **Establishing Shots:** Start sequences with wide shots to orient viewer
- **Shot Variety:** Mix shot types (wide, medium, close) for visual interest
- **Emotional Close-Ups:** Use close-ups for key emotional beats
- **Match on Action:** Cut during movement for seamless flow between shots
- **Eyeline Match:** Maintain consistent eye direction between shots in dialogue
- **180-Degree Rule:** Keep camera on one side of action line for spatial continuity
- **Visual Motifs:** Repeat visual elements to reinforce themes

### Pacing & Rhythm
- **Fast Pacing:** Short shot durations (0.5-2s) for action, excitement, urgency
- **Slow Pacing:** Longer shot durations (3-8s) for emotion, contemplation, atmosphere
- **Rhythm Variation:** Alternate between fast and slow to create dynamic flow
- **Beat Timing:** Align shot changes with music beats when applicable
- **Breathing Room:** Allow pauses for audience processing and emotional impact

### Clarity & Communication
- **One Idea Per Shot:** Each shot should communicate a single clear idea
- **Readable Action:** Ensure character actions are clear and unambiguous
- **Consistent Style:** Maintain similar drawing style and detail level across panels
- **Clear Annotations:** Write legibly, use consistent notation system
- **Numbered Shots:** Sequential numbering prevents confusion in production
- **Version Control:** Clearly mark version numbers and revision dates

## KEY PRINCIPLES

- **Clarity Above All:** Every shot must communicate its purpose instantly and clearly. If a panel is confusing, simplify it.

- **Serve the Story:** Visual choices should always support the narrative, emotional beats, and player experience. Never prioritize "cool shots" over storytelling effectiveness.

- **Respect Production Constraints:** Beautiful storyboards that can't be produced are useless. Always consider asset availability, technical limitations, and timeline realities.

- **Iterate Fearlessly:** First ideas are rarely best ideas. Thumbnail extensively, explore alternatives, and embrace revision as part of the creative process.

- **Communicate Precisely:** Production teams will build exactly what you show them. Be thorough, accurate, and unambiguous in all annotations and specifications.
